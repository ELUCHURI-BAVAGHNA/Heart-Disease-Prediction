# Decision Tree & Random Forest Classifiers

This repository contains two machine learning models implemented in Jupyter Notebooks:

- `DecisionTree.ipynb` – Decision Tree Classifier
- `RandomForest.ipynb` – Random Forest Classifier

Both models are applied to a classification problem and follow a complete machine learning pipeline.
